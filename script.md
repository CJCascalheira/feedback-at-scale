### coding exercises

Here we're asked how many Airbnb listings are included in this dataset? 

And note that the exercise code box has some scaffolding already provided for us.

Suppose you try the ncol function first. That's not the correct answer, but you get specific feedback about your result, and a chance to try again.

Next, suppose try the summary function. That's not the correct answer either, and this time you the feedback you get is a little more generic.

And finally, with nrow, you have the right answer and some encouraging and informative feedback to go along with it.

### more complex coding exercises

Sometimes checking the result is not as straightforward, for example in the case of exercises that result in a visualisation.

In these cases making heavier use of staged hints can be helpful.

### >> back to RStudio editor

so this is what a learnr tutorial looks like for your students. but what does it look like on the back end?

It's an R Markdown document! 

with output: learnr_tutorial

and runtime: shiny_prerendered
