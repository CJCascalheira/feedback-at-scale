# Feedback at scale

As enrolments in statistics and data science courses grow and as these courses become more computational, educators are faced with an interesting challenge -- providing timely and meaningful feedback, particularly with online delivery of courses. The simplest solution is using assignments that are easier to auto-grade, e.g. multiple-choice questions, simplistic coding exercises, but it is impossible to assess mastery of the entire data science cycle using only these types of exercises. In this talk I will discuss writing effective learnr exercises, providing useful and motivating feedback with gradethis, distributing them at scale online and as an R package, and collecting student data for formative assessment with learnrhash.


Hello and welcome! My name is Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.

I'm going to start with a question.

Which of the following is true about me? It says to check all that apply.

I'm part of the education team at RStudio. Also yup!

I am a Senior Lecturer of Stats & Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. Yup again. 

I have four dogs. Well, I love dogs, so let's check that too.
> Submit answer. 

Not quite.

Alright, let's try again. Uncheck the one about dogs, and yay!

And here is one more tidbit -- I love R!

So, where are we? Let's run the code and find out.

Enrolments in statistics and data science courses are on a steady increase - yay

These courses are getting more computational - also yay

Providing timely and meaningful feedback at scale is hard - tell me about it!

Doing so with fully online delivery of courses is even harder - indeed!

In this talk I will discuss writing effective interactive R tutorials using learnr, 

providing useful and motivating feedback with gradethis,

distributing these tutorials at scale (think hundreds of students!) with dsbox, 

and collecting student data for formative assessment with learnrhash.

>> run code

Let's load these packages up, and we're ready to roll!
